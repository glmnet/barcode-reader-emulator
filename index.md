A simple desktop app. Behaves like a real barcode reader device, but doesn't require buying anything ☺️

Triggers barcode 'reading' event with after pressing some hotkey (you configure preferred hotkey yourself).

## Usage

Just download the latest release ZIP and extract the archive anywhere you want. Then run `emulator.exe` file.

### Configuration
Optionally, you can change some settings.
 - __Preferred hotkey__
To change hotkey combination, just click on the read-only hotkey text field and type in the new combination. The new combination should appear as the text field updated value. Then click on "🔃" button to apply the change. Keep in mind that lots of combinations are already bind and cannot be used.
 - __Take a snap of a real barcode to get actual value__
You can also take a snap of an existing barcode (QR or old barcode) on your screen by clicking on "📸" button and capture a screen area with the barcode image. It will be automatically parsed and set to 'Value' field.

### Trigger barcode "read" event
Go to the target place (standalone app, browser tab or any other) which you are going to test with barcode input. Then press the hotkey. Simple enough, isn't it?
